NgxD3GraphsInstall\nnpm i ngx-d3-graphsWhy ngx-d3-graphs\nUnlike other D3 angular chart wrapper libraries, NgxD3Graphs is designed to be very interactive, responsive and dynamic data visualization library \nwith the following features-\n####Supported Graphs-\nLine graph\nBar graph\nScatter plot graph\n Combination of line, bar and scatter plot graph. \n####Features\nMultiple instances of D3 Graph is supported. \nX-axis is a timeline and Y-axis is number by default. \nGraph type, color, font size, legend and axis text is configurable.\nLeft and right y-axis \nTooltip       \nZoom \nCombination of line/bar/scatter plot graph can be drawn with different y-axis \nGraphs are responsive and suitable for web and mobile applications \n\n\n\n##Future Enhancements-\n\nSupport for including more graphs like stacked area, donut, pie charts. \nSupport for Simpl framework \nPerformance improvement for high volume of input data \nMultiple Y-Axis \n\n\n\nDocumentation\nNgxd3Graphs can be used by importing \n\nimport {NgxD3GraphsModule} from \"ngx-d3-graphs\" in the 'app.module.ts'\n\"NgxD3GraphsModule\" module should be imported.\n\nAdd the following selector in your app component html.\n \nwhere-\n\ngraphId- unique string\n\njsonInput- provides json input to ngxd3graphs component \ne.g.,\nid: string= 'graph1'; \n\n\njson input should be given in the following format-\njsonInput = {\"config\":{\"cmd\":\"none\",\"typeProperties\":{\"axisColor\":\"black\",\"axisTextColor\":\"black\",\"xAxisTicks\":3,\"yAxisTicks\":[5,3],\"xAxisText\":\"Timeline\",\"yAxisText\":[\"Speed\",\"Time\"],\"decimalDigits\":2,\"xUnit\":\"hr\",\"yUnit\":[\"km/hr\",\"Hr\"],\"axisCss\":{\"shape-rendering\":\"crispEdges\",\"stroke-width\":\"1.7px\"},\"timeFormat\":\"HH:mm\"},\"advanced\":{\"tooltips\":true,\"legends\":true,\"zoom\":true,\"zoomMinScaleExtent\":1,\"zoomMaxScaleExtent\":4}},\"data\":[{\"dataConfig\":{\"name\":\"Free\",\"legends\":\"L1BY0\",\"type\":\"dot\",\"yIndicator\":\"y1\",\"color\":\"orange\",\"isYNegativeAllowed\":false,\"css\":{\"opacity\":\"0.85\",\"r\":\"5\"}},\"values\":[{\"xAxis\":1521074700000,\"yAxis\":60.1267},{\"xAxis\":1521075600000,\"yAxis\":105.4523},{\"xAxis\":1521076500000,\"yAxis\":99},{\"xAxis\":1521077400000,\"yAxis\":120},{\"xAxis\":1521078300000,\"yAxis\":40},{\"xAxis\":1521079200000,\"yAxis\":86}]},{\"dataConfig\":{\"name\":\"Free\",\"legends\":\"L2BY1\",\"type\":\"bar\",\"yIndicator\":\"y1\",\"isYNegativeAllowed\":false,\"color\":\"blue\",\"css\":{\"fill-opacity\":\"0.65\"}},\"values\":[{\"xAxis\":1521074700000,\"yAxis\":10},{\"xAxis\":1521075600000,\"yAxis\":8},{\"xAxis\":1521076500000,\"yAxis\":3},{\"xAxis\":1521077400000,\"yAxis\":4},{\"xAxis\":1521078300000,\"yAxis\":5},{\"xAxis\":1521079200000,\"yAxis\":6}]},{\"dataConfig\":{\"name\":\"Free\",\"legends\":\"L3LY0\",\"type\":\"line\",\"yIndicator\":\"y0\",\"color\":\"red\",\"isYNegativeAllowed\":false,\"css\":{}},\"values\":[{\"xAxis\":1521074700000,\"yAxis\":80.1267},{\"xAxis\":1521075600000,\"yAxis\":35.4523},{\"xAxis\":1521076500000,\"yAxis\":31},{\"xAxis\":1521077400000,\"yAxis\":20},{\"xAxis\":1521078300000,\"yAxis\":120},{\"xAxis\":1521079200000,\"yAxis\":186}]},{\"dataConfig\":{\"name\":\"Free\",\"legends\":\"L4LY1\",\"type\":\"bar\",\"yIndicator\":\"y1\",\"color\":\"rgb(32, 158, 145)\",\"isYNegativeAllowed\":false,\"css\":{\"fill-opacity\":\"0.65\"}},\"values\":[{\"xAxis\":1521074700000,\"yAxis\":30.5},{\"xAxis\":1521075600000,\"yAxis\":92},{\"xAxis\":1521076500000,\"yAxis\":53},{\"xAxis\":1521077400000,\"yAxis\":74},{\"xAxis\":1521078300000,\"yAxis\":25.56},{\"xAxis\":1521079200000,\"yAxis\":26}]}]}\n where \"type\" defines the type of the graph you want to draw for instance bar,dot or line graphs.\nContributing\nComing Soon\nLicense\nNgxD3Graphs is available under the MIT license.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"modules.html":{"url":"modules.html","title":"modules -
